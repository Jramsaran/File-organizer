Using Imagecyborg, I download the latest One Piece chapters from https://w11.read-onepiece.com/. This downloads all the images on the site, including unwanted images, such as logos, banners and more.

To run the program: type Renamer.py in the CLI with the name of the folder you want the program to clean up (has to be within your Downloads folder).

This is the initial state of the folder:

After running the program, it only leaves me the chapter pages. And if there are duplicates of the same chapter page, the program only returns the page with the best resolution.

This is the folder after running the program:

This program saves me a bunch of time, since there's a new chapter almost every week. Now this tedious process gets automated by a single command line.
